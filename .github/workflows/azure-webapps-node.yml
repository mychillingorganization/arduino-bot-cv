# Deploy Robot AI Controller Frontend to Azure Web App
#
# This workflow builds and deploys the React frontend (client) of the Robot AI Controller project
# to Azure App Service when changes are pushed to the main branch.
#
# PROJECT: Robot AI Controller - Computer Vision Controlled Robotic Arm
# Frontend: React + Vite + MediaPipe Hands for real-time hand tracking
#
# Prerequisites:
# 1. Create an Azure App Service Web App (Node.js runtime)
# 2. Download the Publish Profile from Azure Portal (Web App > Overview > Get publish profile)
# 3. Add the publish profile as a GitHub secret named AZURE_WEBAPP_PUBLISH_PROFILE
# 4. Update AZURE_WEBAPP_NAME below to match your Azure Web App name
#
# Note: This deploys only the frontend. The Node.js server requires serial port access
# and should run locally where the Arduino is connected.
